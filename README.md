*Abstract:*
Models of spatially explicit populations with intrinsic population regulation
are challenging to set up and work with, but vitally important for
understanding ongoing ecological processes. I will present a general class of
Bolker-Pacala models in which fecundity, mortality, and/or establishment rates
depend on local population densities, discuss considerations for stability, and
describe how lineages move in these models. This is an important step in
understanding how to use genomics to inform inferences of ongoing spatial
processes. Simulations are done with SLiM and lienages are recorded using the
tree sequence.

SLiM code for the cautionary example, by Gilia Patterson, is at `gilia_clumping_sim.slim`.
