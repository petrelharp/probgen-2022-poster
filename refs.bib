abstract = {Representations of branching Markov processes and their measure-valued limits in terms of countable systems of particles are constructed for models with spatially varying birth and death rates. Each particle has a location and a “level,” but unlike earlier constructions, the levels change with time. In fact, death of a particle occurs only when the level of the particle crosses a specified level r, or for the limiting models, hits infinity. For branching Markov processes, at each time t, conditioned on the state of the process, the levels are independent and uniformly distributed on [0, r]. For the limiting measure-valued process, at each time t, the joint distribution of locations and levels is conditionally Poisson distributed with mean measure K(t)×Λ, where Λ denotes Lebesgue measure, and K is the desired measure-valued process. The representation simplifies or gives alternative proofs for a variety of calculations and results including conditioning on extinction or nonextinction, Harris’s convergence theorem for supercritical branching processes, and diffusion approximations for processes in random environments.},

  abstract = {The paper studies the spatial distribution of individuals competing for a continuously distributed
resource in one-dimensional space. An individual diffuses randomly, and is assumed to suffer a cost
of mortality from neighbors. The population dynamics are then described by an extended version of
the Lotka–Volterra competition equation with terms of growth and diffusion, and the term of
neighborhood competition/interference through an integral kernel. By allowing neighboring individuals
to compete with each other, the pattern of spatial distribution changes drastically from that of the
classical models without any neighborhood competition: in the classical models, any spatial variation
in resource availability is smoothed out in the stationary distribution of species utilizing it. However,
in the present model, even negligibly small spatial variation in resource availability could trigger a
strongly clumped distribution of the species with a characteristic wavelength. Significant amplification
of intermediate spatial frequencies occurs if the width of detrimental influence exceeds the mean distance
an individual diffuses before it reproduces. In the extreme of no diffusion, the stationary distribution
(the ideal free distribution) is strictly discrete (the support of distribution given by a set of points).
The model also reveals the condition for a periodic/quasi-periodic traveling wave when the species
is expanding in space, and demonstrates complex spatial distributions in two dimension.},

@article{bolker2003spatial,
  abstract = { Abstract: A variety of models have shown that spatial dynamics and small‐scale endogenous heterogeneity (e.g., forest gaps or local resource depletion zones) can change the rate and outcome of competition in communities of plants or other sessile organisms. However, the theory appears complicated and hard to connect to real systems. We synthesize results from three different kinds of models: interacting particle systems, moment equations for spatial point processes, and metapopulation or patch models. Studies using all three frameworks agree that spatial dynamics need not enhance coexistence nor slow down dynamics; their effects depend on the underlying competitive interactions in the community. When similar species would coexist in a nonspatial habitat, endogenous spatial structure inhibits coexistence and slows dynamics. When a dominant species disperses poorly and the weaker species has higher fecundity or better dispersal, competition‐colonization trade‐offs enhance coexistence. Even when species have equal dispersal and per‐generation fecundity, spatial successional niches where the weaker and faster‐growing species can rapidly exploit ephemeral local resources can enhance coexistence. When interspecific competition is strong, spatial dynamics reduce founder control at large scales and short dispersal becomes advantageous. We describe a series of empirical tests to detect and distinguish among the suggested scenarios. },

  abstract = {Spatial patterns in biological populations and the effect of spatial patterns on ecological interactions are central topics in mathematical ecology. Various approaches to modeling have been developed to enable us to understand spatial patterns ranging from plant distributions to plankton aggregation. We present a new approach to modeling spatial interactions by deriving approximations for the time evolution of the moments (mean and spatial covariance) of ensembles of distributions of organisms; the analysis is made possible by “moment closure,” neglecting higher-order spatial structure in the population. We use the growth and competition of plants in an explicitly spatial environment as a starting point for exploring the properties of second-order moment equations and comparing them to realizations of spatial stochastic models. We find that for a wide range of effective neighborhood sizes (each plant interacting with several to dozens of neighbors), the mean-covariance model provides a useful and analytically tractable approximation to the stochastic spatial model, and combines useful features of stochastic models and traditional reaction-diffusion-like models.},
